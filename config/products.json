However it has more combinations and is trickier to solve. There are an additional 12 hidden pieces that need to be positioned and correctly orientated. These pieces correspond to the middle edges on a 5x5x5 though not as straightforward to deal with. They are only properly visible between completed moves (see the photos). All moves are accessed from the exterior cube so you never have to reach in and touch the ball.","imageUrl":"http://tonyfisherpuzzles.net/images/001BC650.jpg","difficultyLevel":"5"}]
